            The second creative element that I have selected for this assessment is a purely informative Powerpoint Presentation. Some might question why Microsoft Powerpoint was chosen instead of the more popular amongst organisations, Google Slides. I chose to utilise Microsoft Powerpoint instead of Google Slides because I’ve always used Google Slides for my projects. However, if you look at the use case that Microsoft Powerpoint has over Google Slides, Powerpoint is generally more professional than Slides because of its greater capability and compatibility across devices and services. “<i>As [Microsoft] Powerpoint is one of the oldest software, it comes with a variety of features and effects</i>”, (<a href="https://www.educba.com/powerpoint-vs-google-slides/">educba.com</a>). The only issue was, since I’ve always used Google Slides, Microsoft Powerpoint was completely foreign to me. I obviously had a general idea on how it worked since I used it once in Year 3, but of course updates have occurred and I wanted to utilise as much of the capability as possible. Therefore, most of the time that I dedicated to this assessment was put towards the Powerpoint so make it as fluent and streamlined as possible. This was done by having each page clearly labelled in the previous slide. For example, the character profiles show two characters and an overall page for the summary.

            The reason why I chose a Powerpoint Presentation as the second creative response was so I could reciprocate the type of presentation from the poster, namely the informative part. When presenting information, it is better to use words in a structured format so the viewer or reader can accurately understand what the presenter is trying to demonstrate or present to everyone. The Powerpoint Presentation allows me to go into more detail including separate character analysis on what their role was in their respective movie.
