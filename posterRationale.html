            The first creative element I have chosen to make for this assessment is a poster and its purpose is to make it abundantly clear to the audience that fatherhood themes are present in the two films Treasure Planet and Good Will Hunting. There are two main elements on this poster that make the themes clear; the pictures and the title near the centre. When the audience first sees the poster, their attention will immediately be drawn to the pictures around. However, they’ll become disinterested since there is no supplying context for them to link to the pictures so the audience will draw their attention to the middle of the page where the single word, “Fatherhood” will be found. This word is the supplying context that the audience is looking for, so naturally they will start looking at the pictures again, but the difference is that they will better understand its purpose and will in turn, look into the deeper meanings of the pictures.

            We’ll go into more detail about John Silver’s (<i>Treasure Planet</i>) role of fatherhood and its beginnings later in the second creative response but right now, we can understand two things. First, we know that at the very beginning of the movie, Jim and Silver do not get along with each other since Jim suspects Silver of being the cyborg that crashed his mothers inn and Silver doesn’t want Jim to get in the way of his plotting.( “<i>He decides to give Jim so much work that he won't notice any plotting. However, as the journey passes and Silver gets to know how strong-willed and determined Jim is, they form a father-son relationship.</i>”, (<a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/John_Silver#:~:text=Treasure%20Planet,-Initially%2C%20Captain%20Amelia&text=He%20decides%20to%20give%20Jim,form%20a%20father-son%20relationship.">Disney Fandom</a>). We even see later down the course of the movie, John and Silver end up fighting instead of working with each other only to continue the father son dynamic towards the end. “What happens, is that this version of John Silver is reformed at the end of the film, since Scroop is revealed as the main antagonist.”, (<a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/John_Silver?commentId=4400000000000395749">Anita2021, Disney Fandom Comments</a>). This ending is reflected in the very bottom picture which is showing Jim and Silver embracing each other.

            While Silver’s character development was very different from the usual where two people with a father-son type relationship end up fighting each other only to be back how they used to be, Sean’s behaviour (<i>Good Will Hunting</i>) remained relatively constant throughout the course of Good Will Hunting (1997). There were a few differences between the two characters but one main difference that had been overlooked was the fact that Silver took it upon himself to help Jim in Treasure Planet but Sean (<i>Good Will Hunting</i>) was hired by a third party (Prof. Lambeau). Even then, unlike the previous therapists who gave up on Will who mocked them, Sean challenged Will’s behaviours since he recognised the reason why Will was acting against him and adapted accordingly. Sean even ended up having an argument with Prof. Lambeau who expected academic results from Will when Sean was focused on his personal development into becoming a fully functional adult. We can see he truly cared about Will when Sean gave him another chance at the early moments of the film. “<i>Will’s first meeting with Sean doesn’t go well as Will presumes too much about Sean’s [dead] wife which enrages him. However, Sean gives the boy another shot but still decides to put him in his place.</i>”, (<a href="http://screenrant.com/good-will-hunting-best-quotes/">screenrant.com</a>).
            <br>
            <br>
            Just like Jim and Silver from Treasure Planet, Sean and Will’s relationship at first wasn’t as smooth going from the beginning either. A prime example was when Will noticed Sean's painting in the office and launched into a conversation with Sean about how his wife died from cancer. However, Will ends up making some offensive comments based purely on assumptions only. Naturally, Sean gets violent and puts Will into a chokehold on the wall, relises his error, then lets go. We can see this behaviour is different from the Sean we get to meet and know very well later down the course of the movie but as of the current moment, it would seem as though Sean can get provoked very easily. Sean realises and “<i>points out how Will has read a lot about life in books, but there's so much he doesn't know about actual experiences.</i>”, (<a href="https://screenrant.com/good-will-hunting-best-quotes/">screenrant.com</a>). Near the end of the movie, Sean and Will now have a bound father-son relationship and this is mildly demonstrated with Will’s last scene of driving off into the distance leaving Sean to live his life, just like how a grown up matured son of a father drives off to live the rest of his life. We now truly know that Sean has achieved his goal as a father-figure.
