            The first creative element I have chosen to make for this assessment is a poster and its purpose is to make it abundantly clear to the audience that fatherhood themes are present in the two films Treasure Planet and Good Will Hunting. There are two main elements on this poster that make the themes clear; the pictures, and the title near the centre. When the audience first sees the poster, their attention will immediately be drawn to the pictures around. However, they’ll become disinterested since there is no supplying context for them to link to the pictures so the audience will draw their attention to the middle of the page where the single word, “Fatherhood” will be found. This word is the supplying context that the audience is looking for, so naturally they will start looking at the pictures again, but the difference is that they will understand it’s purpose more and in turn, will look into the deeper meanings of the pictures.
