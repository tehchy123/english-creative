                For this creative task/assessment, I chose to visualise the theme of fatherhood in Treasure Planet and Good Will Hunting. I chose these two instead of one of the other films available because these are the two that clearly demonstrated the target theme of fatherhood in an obvious manner and they were the two films that made it clear to the audience early on that the plot was going to be about spiritual and mental connections between two people. I chose to code a basic website so I had a place where I could neatly organise and include all of my responses. I chose to use GitHub as my place where I organised all my code and I even used it to host my webpage so it can be accessed through the internet (Github Repository Here).

                Inside the website I put two main creative responses/pieces. The first was a simple poster with the word “fatherhood” in the middle and it had snapshots from the Treasure Planet and Good Will Hunting movie. This was done in a way so the viewer of the poster would see the word “fatherhood” (which would tell them that this is the theme that the creator is demonstrating). Then the viewer would see the snapshots from both movies surrounding the word. These snapshots are the key moments in both movies that put forward the idea that a father figure is necessary for the livelihood of a young adolescent boy. However, having just a poster without reading the rationale which had the purpose of explaining it wouldn’t do much good since a poster can only communicate so much. The most effective way of communicating precise ideas is speech or utilising vocabulary which is why I did a second creative response, a Powerpoint Presentation.

                I chose the Powerpoint Presentation to be my second creative response because it had a simple purpose in relation to the Poster. The poster was for the visual element and the Powerpoint was for the textual analysis. As opposed to the simple poster, the Powerpoint was more complex so naturally it took more of my time to complete fully. There are two reasons for this. First, writing all the analytical explanations in a way that made sense whilst driving the main idea and second, displaying the presentation in a fashion that would integrate nicely with the webpage that it was going to be hosted on, (there is no point for there to be a powerpoint if the audience won't be able to even see it). The theme and main goal for the presentation was to describe the theme of fatherhood, (sub-theming). This was achieved by providing an overall basic summary and served as a low level synopsis of the theme of fatherhood. The continuing pages would go on to elaborate upon the synopsis by targeting the two main characters that demonstrated the theme of fatherhood the most, Sean (Good Will Hunting) and Silver (Treasure Planet). On each of these pages there would be a low level explanation of their role in their respective movies, providing context for the scene where the fatherhood theme was most prevalent, then go on to describe the scene with detail. After these two explanations, there would be another page providing a summary of the two characters' fatherhood scenes and link them back to the synopsis only to eventually be linked back to the definition of fatherhood.

                Overall, the purpose and aim for this assessment was to analyse a chosen theme by providing a creative response that could be linked together with a rationale. I sought out to achieve this standard by choosing two creative topics and doing a rationale like description of those both, then I would provide an overall rationale on the entire assignment, namely, the website, the poster and the Powerpoint presentation.
